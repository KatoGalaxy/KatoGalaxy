I guess this is a feature, huh?

Hi, I'm Kato!! I'm a 20 year old nonbinary thing that has absolutely no idea what they're doing with their life. I like my friends and drawing and arcade games, mostly. I'm not a great programmer but I can do some basic stuff, mainly python, and also a little bit of java and javascript
